Project guide

The dataset is from "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset Data Set" https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset

- Task 1 - Build a highly predictive classification model. Train the model on data entries corresponding to the months of June-Dec, and test the model on data entries corresponding to Feb-March.


- Task 2: Generate user-behavior clusters based on the purchasing behavior data for the complete dataset.

- Task 3: Consider you have training data (with the 'Revenue' attribute) for records from June-Sept only. For all records from Oct-Dec, the 'Revenue' attribute is missing. Build a semi-supervised self-labeling model to estimate 'Revenue' for the missing records in Oct-Dec and then fit your classifier. Report classification performance on Feb-March data set with and without the self-labeled data.
